# Brain-Wiring
A group of scientists measure brain activitives from 15 brain regions of 820 subjects. Each subject is measured 4800 times for each region, and such data are stored as a 4800 x 15 matrix in a file as “subXXXXXX.txt” where XXXXXX is the subject ID. The complete dataset should contain 820 files. We will use this dataset to practice the data management and analytical tools.
